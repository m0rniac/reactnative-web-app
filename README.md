# 🤳 React Native Mobile Web-APP (with Swipe To Refresh)

A mobile app builded with ExpoCLI and React Native, displays a web page within a WebView component. It includes "pull-to-refresh" functionality and handles errors for internet connection issues. The interface uses components like ScrollView and Modal, with styles defined in StyleSheet. The code is structured following best development practices and is easy to maintain. It's crucial to consider security and performance when loading external web content into a WebView.
